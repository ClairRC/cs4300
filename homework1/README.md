To run each task, simply run "python3 path_to_test", and each one should run an example script to show general behavior. (For task 6 specifically, this must be run from the "homework1" directory or "src" directory.)

To run the tests, simply run "pytest" from the "homework1" directory. This will run all of the tests and show that they are all passing I am hoping.
